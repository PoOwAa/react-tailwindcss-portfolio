The purpose of this migration was to change the whitelist policy to blacklist policy and add some extra features to the token. Additionally, the BNOx was planned to be introduced on several trading sites, such as LBank.`,

Another challenge was to deploy the new BNOx token and migrate the current balances of every BNOx holder to the new token address without any errors or loss of funds. Furthermore, it was necessary to work with an audit company to check the smart contract and ensure its security. Lastly, it was important to introduce the BNOx on several trading sites to increase its market value and adoption.`,

This allowed me to test every part of the code before deployment. I managed the planning, deployment and other administrative works, such as putting the token on etherscan, and worked with an audit company to ensure the security of the smart contract. After successful deployment, BlockBen was able to introduce the BNOx on several trading sites, such as LBank, which increased its market value and adoption.`,
